Greek tragedy led to Greek comedy and, together, these genres formed the foundation upon which all modern theatre is based. In the Roman world, tragedy plays were translated and imitated in Latin, and the genre gave rise to a new art form from the 1st century BCE, pantomime, which drew inspiration from the presentation and subject matter of Greek tragedy.",
